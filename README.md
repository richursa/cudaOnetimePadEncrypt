# cudaOnetimePadEncrypt
cuda implementation of one time pad encryption algorithm 
one time pad is a simple encryption algorithm which uses a random key of the same size as the file to be encrypted.
this implementation encrypts data by xor'ing it with random bytes.
one time pad is a perfect cipher and is unbreakable.
